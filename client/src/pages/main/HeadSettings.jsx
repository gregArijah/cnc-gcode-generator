            The Settings tab in our app provides users with a dedicated space to customize their G-code preferences and other configuration options. It allows users to fine-tune parameters such as feed rates, tool offsets, and machine-specific settings, empowering them to tailor the app to their specific CNC machining requirements and optimize the generation of G-code for their machines.
