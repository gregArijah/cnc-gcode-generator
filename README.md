## Introduction

A brief introduction to the project.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface:** Javatrol's browser-based conversational interface allows users to generate toolpaths and create CNC programs without the need for manual coding. The intuitive and natural language commands make it easy for hobbyists, machinists, and engineers to use.

- **Cloud Storage:** Javatrol enables users to save their work in the cloud, eliminating the need for local file management. This allows for easy access to projects from anywhere with an internet connection.

- **G-code Output:** Javatrol generates ISO-standard G-code, compatible with a wide range of CNC machines, ensuring seamless integration with existing machining setups.

- **Time and Cost Savings:** By providing on-the-spot toolpath generation on the shop floor, Javatrol saves time by reducing the reliance on a separate programming office. Additionally, it eliminates the need for expensive software licenses, resulting in cost savings for CNC machining operations.

- **MERN Stack:** Javatrol is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, leveraging the power of JavaScript and its ecosystem to deliver a robust and scalable web application.
